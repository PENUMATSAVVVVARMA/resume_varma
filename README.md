# Deployment Instructions for GitHub Pages

This README provides detailed instructions on how to deploy your project using GitHub Pages.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure you have a GitHub account and a repository created.
- Your project should be ready to be deployed, with all necessary files included in your repository.

## Steps to Deploy

1. **Go to Your Repository**  
   Navigate to your repository on GitHub.

2. **Access the Settings**  
   Click on the 'Settings' tab in your repository.

3. **Scroll to GitHub Pages Section**  
   Find the section labeled "GitHub Pages".

4. **Select the Source**  
   - Under the "Source" dropdown, select the branch you want to use (typically `main` or `gh-pages`).
   - Choose the root or `/docs` folder depending on where your index.html is located.

5. **Save**  
   Click the "Save" button.

6. **Check Your Site**  
   After a few minutes, your site will be published at the URL provided on the same page (usually `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/`). 

## Troubleshooting
- Make sure your repository is public.
- Ensure that your `index.html` file is in the root or the specified folder.

## Updating Your Site
- To update your website, simply make changes to your files and push them to the selected branch. GitHub Pages will automatically update the site after a few minutes.
